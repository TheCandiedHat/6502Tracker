# 6502Tracker
A Python based, music tracker style "game engine" for creating NES games without the huge drawbacks from C, or the long, repetitive 6502 Assembly.

## About
Ever programmed a NES game in 6502? Even just put a picture on the screen, without copy and paste? If so, you'll understand the reason for the creation of this project. This tool is designed to be used by people of all skill level, from someone who just decided they wanted to make a NES game 5 minutes ago, to the lead developers of Super Mario Bros.

## Contributing to this project
Want to help? Great! All you need is basic understanding of python, although the more experience the better. Just create a pull request with your updates to the code to start! If you help out enough, and I decide I trust you, you could be added to the project. Thanks to anyone who helps!
